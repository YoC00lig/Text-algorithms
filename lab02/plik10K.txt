PREFACE


      Christmas is one of the great days of obligation and observance
      in the Church of which I am a Priest; but it is much more than
      that, it is one of the great days of obligation and observance in
      the world. Furthermore it is one of the evidences of the power of
      Him Whose birth we commemorate that its observation is not
      limited by conditions of race and creed. Those who fail to see in
      Him what we see nevertheless see something and even by imperfect
      visions are moved to joy. The world transmutes that joy into
      blessing, not merely by giving of its substance but of its soul
      because men perceive that it is for the soul’s good and because
      they hope to receive its benefits although they well know that
      giving is far better than receiving, in the very words of Him Who
      gave us the greatest of all gifts—Himself.

      As a Priest of the Church, as a Missionary in the Far West, as
      the Rector of large and important parishes I have been brought in
      touch with varied life. Christmas in all its phases is familiar
      to me. The author of many books and stories as well as the
      preacher of many sermons, it is natural that Christmas should
      have engaged a large part of my attention. Out of the abundance
      of material which I have accumulated in the course of a long
      ministry and a longer life I have gathered here a sheaf of things
      I have written about Christmas; personal adventures, stories
      suggested by the old yet ever-new theme; meditations, words of
      advice which I am old enough to be entitled to give; and last but
      not least good wishes and good will. I might even call this
      little volume _A Book of Good Will toward Men_. And so fit it not
      only for Christmas but for all other seasons as well.

      If it shall add to your joy in Christmas, dear reader, and better
      still, if it shall move you to add to the joy of some one else at
      Christmas-tide or in any other season, I shall be well repaid for
      my efforts and incidentally you will also be repaid for your
      purchase.

A CHRISTMAS GREETING

      “_Good Will Toward Men”—St. Luke 11-14._


      There was a time when the spirit of Christmas was of the present.
      There is a period when most of it is of the past. There shall
      come a day perhaps when all of it will be of the future. The
      child time, the present; the middle years, the past; old age, the
      future.

      Come to my mind Christmas Days of long ago. As a boy again I
      enter into the spirit of the Christmas stockings hanging before
      my fire. I know what the children think to-day. I recall what
      they feel.
