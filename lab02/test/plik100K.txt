PREFACE


      Christmas is one of the great days of obligation and observance
      in the Church of which I am a Priest; but it is much more than
      that, it is one of the great days of obligation and observance in
      the world. Furthermore it is one of the evidences of the power of
      Him Whose birth we commemorate that its observation is not
      limited by conditions of race and creed. Those who fail to see in
      Him what we see nevertheless see something and even by imperfect
      visions are moved to joy. The world transmutes that joy into
      blessing, not merely by giving of its substance but of its soul
      because men perceive that it is for the soul’s good and because
      they hope to receive its benefits although they well know that
      giving is far better than receiving, in the very words of Him Who
      gave us the greatest of all gifts—Himself.

      As a Priest of the Church, as a Missionary in the Far West, as
      the Rector of large and important parishes I have been brought in
      touch with varied life. Christmas in all its phases is familiar
      to me. The author of many books and stories as well as the
      preacher of many sermons, it is natural that Christmas should
      have engaged a large part of my attention. Out of the abundance
      of material which I have accumulated in the course of a long
      ministry and a longer life I have gathered here a sheaf of things
      I have written about Christmas; personal adventures, stories
      suggested by the old yet ever-new theme; meditations, words of
      advice which I am old enough to be entitled to give; and last but
      not least good wishes and good will. I might even call this
      little volume _A Book of Good Will toward Men_. And so fit it not
      only for Christmas but for all other seasons as well.

      If it shall add to your joy in Christmas, dear reader, and better
      still, if it shall move you to add to the joy of some one else at
      Christmas-tide or in any other season, I shall be well repaid for
      my efforts and incidentally you will also be repaid for your
      purchase.

A CHRISTMAS GREETING

      “_Good Will Toward Men”—St. Luke 11-14._


      There was a time when the spirit of Christmas was of the present.
      There is a period when most of it is of the past. There shall
      come a day perhaps when all of it will be of the future. The
      child time, the present; the middle years, the past; old age, the
      future.

      Come to my mind Christmas Days of long ago. As a boy again I
      enter into the spirit of the Christmas stockings hanging before
      my fire. I know what the children think to-day. I recall what
      they feel.

      Passes childhood, and I look down the nearer years. There rise
      before me remembrances of Christmas Days on storm-tossed seas,
      where waves beat upon the ice-bound ship. I recall again the
      bitter touch of water-warping winter, of drifts of snow, of
      wind-swept plains. In the gamut of my remembrance I am once more
      in the poor, mean, lonely little sanctuary out on the prairie,
      with a handful of Christians, mostly women, gathered together in
      the freezing, draughty building. In later years I worship in the
      great cathedral church, ablaze with lights, verdant and fragrant
      with the evergreen pines, echoing with joyful carols and
      celestial harmonies. My recollections are of contrasts like those
      of life—joy and sadness, poverty and ease.

      And the pictures are full of faces, many of which may be seen no
      more by earthly vision. I miss the clasp of vanished hands, I
      crave the sound of voices stilled. As we old and older grow,
      there is a note of sadness in our glee. Whether we will or not we
      must twine the cypress with the holly. The recollection of each
      passing year brings deeper regret. How many have gone from those
      circles that we recall when we were children? How many little
      feet that pattered upon the stair on Christmas morning now tread
      softer paths and walk in broader ways; sisters and brothers who
      used to come back from the far countries to the old home—alas,
      they cannot come from the farther country in which they now are,
      and perhaps, saddest thought of all, we would not wish them to
      come again. How many, with whom we joined hands around the
      Christmas tree, have gone?

      Circles are broken, families are separated, loved ones are lost,
      but the old world sweeps on. Others come to take our places. As
      we stood at the knee of some unforgotten mother, so other
      children stand. As we listened to the story of the Christ Child
      from the lips of some grey old father, so other children listen
      and we ourselves perchance are fathers or mothers too. Other
      groups come to us for the deathless story. Little heads which
      recall vanished halcyon days of youth bend around another younger
      mother. Smaller hands than ours write letters to Santa Claus and
      hear the story, the sweetest story ever told, of the Baby who
      came to Mary and through her to all the daughters and sons of
      women on that winter night on the Bethlehem hills.

      And we thank God for the children who take us out of the past,
      out of ourselves, away from recollections that weigh us down; the
      children that weave in the woof and warp of life when our own
      youth has passed, some of the buoyancy, the joy, the happiness of
      the present; the children in whose opening lives we turn
      hopefully to the future. We thank God at this Christmas season
      that it pleased Him to send His beloved Son to come to us as a
      little child, like any other child. We thank God that in the
      lesser sense we may see in every child who comes to-day another
      incarnation of divinity. We thank God for the portion of His
      Spirit with which He dowers every child of man, just as we thank
      Him for pouring it all upon the Infant in the Manger.

      There is no age that has not had its prophet. No country, no
      people, but that has produced its leader. But did any of them
      ever before come as a little child? Did any of them begin to lead
      while yet in arms? Lodges there upon any other baby brow “the
      round and top of sovereignty?” What distinguished Christ and His
      Christian followers from all the world? Behold! no mighty
      monarch, but “a little child shall lead them!”

      You may see through the glass darkly, you may not know or
      understand the blessedness of faith in Him as He would have you
      know it, but there is nothing that can dim the light that
      radiates from that birth in the rude cave back of the inn. Ah, it
      pierces through the darkness of that shrouding night. It shines
      to-day. Still sparkles the Star in the East. He is that Star.

      There is nothing that can take from mankind—even doubting
      mankind—the spirit of Christ and the Christmas season. Our
      celebrations do not rest upon the conclusions of logic, or the
      demonstrations of philosophy; I would not even argue that they
      depend inevitably or absolutely upon the possession of a certain
      faith in Jesus, but we accept Christmas, nevertheless; we
      endeavour to apply the Christmas spirit, for just once in the
      year; it may be because we cannot, try as we may, crush out
      utterly and entirely the divinity that is in us that makes for
      God. The stories and tales for Christmas which have for their
      theme the hard heart softened are not mere fictions of the
      imagination. They rest upon an instinctive consciousness of a
      profound philosophic truth.

      What is the unpardonable sin, I wonder? Is it to be persistently
      and forever unkind? Does it mean perhaps the absolute refusal to
      accept the principle of love which is indeed creation’s final
      law? The lessons of the Christmastide are so many; the appeals
      that now may be made to humanity crowd to the lips from full
      minds and fuller hearts. Might we not reduce them all to the
      explication of the underlying principle of God’s purpose to us,
      as expressed in those themic words of love with which angels and
      men greeted the advent of the Child on the first Christmas
      morning, “Good will toward men?”

      Let us then show our good will toward men by doing good and
      bringing happiness to someone—if not to everyone—at this
      Christmas season. Put aside the memories of disappointments, of
      sorrows that have not vanished, of cares that still burden, and
      do good in spite of them because you would not dim the brightness
      of the present for any human heart with the shadows of old
      regrets. Do good because of a future which opens possibilities
      before you, for others, if not for yourselves.

      Brethren, friends, all, let us make up our minds that we will be
      kindly affectioned one to another in our homes and out of them,
      on this approaching Christmas day. That the old debate, the
      ancient strife, the rankling recollection, the sharp contention,
      shall be put aside, that “envy, hatred, and malice, and all
      uncharitableness” shall be done away with. Let us forgive and
      forget; but if we cannot forget let us at least forgive. And so
      let there be peace between man and man at Christmas—a truce of
      God.

      Let us pray that Love shall come as a little child to our
      households. That He shall be in our hearts and shall find His
      expression in all that we do or say on this birthday of goodness
      and cheer for the world. Then let us resolve that the spirit of
      the day shall be carried out through our lives, that as Christ
      did not come for an hour, but for a lifetime, we would fain
      become as little children on this day of days that we may begin a
      new life of good will to men.

      Let us make this a new birthday of kindness and love that shall
      endure. That is a Christmas hope, a Christmas wish. Let us give
      to it the gracious expression of life among men.

FROM A FAR COUNTRY

      _Being a New Variation of an Ancient Theme_

      A STORY FOR GROWN-UPS


      I

      “_A certain man had two sons_”—so begins the best and most famous
      story in the world’s literature. Use of the absolute superlative
      is always dangerous, but none will gainsay that statement, I am
      sure. This story, which follows that familiar tale afar off,
      indeed, begins in the same way. And the parallelism between the
      two is exact up to a certain point. What difference a little
      point doth make; like the little fire, behold, how great a matter
      it kindleth! Indeed, lacking that one detail the older story
      would have had no value; it would not have been told; without its
      addition this would have been a repetition of the other.

      When the modern young prodigal came to himself, when he found
      himself no longer able to endure the husks of the swine like his
      ancient exemplar, when he rose and returned to his father because
      of that distaste, he found no father watching and waiting for him
      at the end of the road! Upon that change the action of this story
      hangs. It was a pity, too, because the elder brother was there
      and in a mood not unlike that of his famous prototype.

      Indeed, there was added to that elder brother’s natural
      resentment at the younger’s course the blinding power of a great
      sorrow, for the father of the two sons was dead. He had died of a
      broken heart. Possessed of no omniscience of mind or vision, he
      had been unable to foresee the long delayed turning point in the
      career of his younger son and death came too swiftly to enable
      them to meet again. So long as he had strength, that father had
      stood, as it were, at the top of the hill looking down the road
      watching and hoping.

      And but the day before the tardy prodigal’s return he had been
      laid away with his own fathers in the God’s acre around the
      village church in the Pennsylvania hills. Therefore there was no
      fatted calf ready for the disillusioned youth whose waywardness
      had killed his father. It will be remembered that the original
      elder brother objected seriously to fatted calves on such
      occasions. Indeed, the funeral baked meats would coldly furnish
      forth a welcoming meal if any such were called for.

      For all his waywardness, for all his self-will, the younger son
      had loved his father well, and it was a terrible shock to him
      (having come to his senses) to find that he had returned too
      late. And for all his hardness and narrowness the eldest son also
      had loved his father well—strong tribute to the quality of the
      dead parent—and when he found himself bereft he naturally visited
      wrath upon the head of him who he believed rightly was the cause
      of the untimely death of the old man.

      As he sat in the study, if such it might be called, of the
      departed, before the old-fashioned desk with its household and
      farm and business accounts, which in their order and method and
      long use were eloquent of his provident and farseeing father, his
      heart was hot within his breast. Grief and resentment alike
      gnawed at his vitals. They had received vivid reports, even in
      the little town in which they dwelt, of the wild doings of the
      wanderer, but they had enjoyed no direct communication with him.
      After a while even rumour ceased to busy itself with the doings
      of the youth. He had dropped out of their lives utterly after he
      passed over the hills and far away.

      The father had failed slowly for a time, only to break suddenly
      and swiftly in the end. And the hurried frantic search for the
      missing had brought no results. Ironically the god of chance had
      led the young man’s repentant footsteps to the door too late.

      “Where’s father?” cried John Carstairs to the startled woman who
      stared at him as if she had seen a ghost as, at his knock, she
      opened the door which he had found locked, not against him, but
      the hour was late and it was the usual nightly precaution:

      “Your brother is in your father’s study, sir,” faltered the
      servant at last.

      “Umph! Will,” said the man, his face changing. “I’d rather see
      father first.”

      “I think you had better see Mr. William, sir.”

      “What’s the matter, Janet?” asked young Carstairs anxiously. “Is
      father ill?”

      “Yes, sir! indeed I think you had bettor see Mr. William at once,
      Mr. John.”

      Strangely moved by the obvious agitation of the ancient servitor
      of the house who had known him from childhood, John Carstairs
      hurried down the long hall to the door of his father’s study.
      Always a scapegrace, generally in difficulties, full of mischief,
      he had approached that door many times in fear of well merited
      punishment which was sure to be meted out to him. And he came to
      it with the old familiar apprehension that night, if from a
      different cause. He never dreamed that his father was anything
      but ill. He must see his brother. He stood in no little awe of
      that brother, who was his exact antithesis in almost everything.
      They had not got along particularly well. If his father had been
      inside the door he would have hesitated with his hand on the
      knob. If his father had not been ill he would not have attempted
      to face his brother. But his anxiety, which was increased by a
      sudden foreboding, for Janet, the maid, had looked at him so
      strangely, moved him to quick action. He threw the door open
      instantly. What he saw did not reassure him. William was clad in
      funeral black. He wore a long frock coat instead of the usual
      knockabout suit he affected on the farm. His face was white and
      haggard. There was an instant interchange of names.

      “John!”

      “William!”

      And then—

      “Is father ill?” burst out the younger.

      “Janet said—”

      “Dead!” interposed William harshly, all his indignation flaming
      into speech and action as he confronted the cause of the
      disaster.

      “Dead! Good God!”

      “God had nothing to do with it.”

      “You mean?”

      “You did it.”

      “I?”

      “Yes. Your drunken revelry, your reckless extravagance, your
      dissipation with women, your unfeeling silence, your—”

      “Stop!” cried the younger. “I have come to my senses, I can’t
      bear it.”

      “I’ll say it if it kills you. You did it, I repeat. He longed and
      prayed and waited and you didn’t come. You didn’t write. We could
      hear nothing. The best father on earth.”

      The younger man sank down in a chair and covered his face with
      his hands.

      “When?” he gasped out finally.

      in the poor, mean, lonely little sanctuary out on the prairie,
      with a handful of Christians, mostly women, gathered together in
      the freezing, draughty building. In later years I worship in the
      great cathedral church, ablaze with lights, verdant and fragrant
      with the evergreen pines, echoing with joyful carols and
      celestial harmonies. My recollections are of contrasts like those
      of life—joy and sadness, poverty and ease.

      And the pictures are full of faces, many of which may be seen no
      more by earthly vision. I miss the clasp of vanished hands, I
      crave the sound of voices stilled. As we old and older grow,
      there is a note of sadness in our glee. Whether we will or not we
      must twine the cypress with the holly. The recollection of each
      passing year brings deeper regret. How many have gone from those
      circles that we recall when we were children? How many little
      feet that pattered upon the stair on Christmas morning now tread
      softer paths and walk in broader ways; sisters and brothers who
      used to come back from the far countries to the old home—alas,
      they cannot come from the farther country in which they now are,
      and perhaps, saddest thought of all, we would not wish them to
      come again. How many, with whom we joined hands around the
      Christmas tree, have gone?

      Circles are broken, families are separated, loved ones are lost,
      but the old world sweeps on. Others come to take our places. As
      we stood at the knee of some unforgotten mother, so other
      children stand. As we listened to the story of the Christ Child
      from the lips of some grey old father, so other children listen
      and we ourselves perchance are fathers or mothers too. Other
      groups come to us for the deathless story. Little heads which
      recall vanished halcyon days of youth bend around another younger
      mother. Smaller hands than ours write letters to Santa Claus and
      hear the story, the sweetest story ever told, of the Baby who
      came to Mary and through her to all the daughters and sons of
      women on that winter night on the Bethlehem hills.

      And we thank God for the children who take us out of the past,
      out of ourselves, away from recollections that weigh us down; the
      children that weave in the woof and warp of life when our own
      youth has passed, some of the buoyancy, the joy, the happiness of
      the present; the children in whose opening lives we turn
      hopefully to the future. We thank God at this Christmas season
      that it pleased Him to send His beloved Son to come to us as a
      little child, like any other child. We thank God that in the
      lesser sense we may see in every child who comes to-day another
      incarnation of divinity. We thank God for the portion of His
      Spirit with which He dowers every child of man, just as we thank
      Him for pouring it all upon the Infant in the Manger.

      There is no age that has not had its prophet. No country, no
      people, but that has produced its leader. But did any of them
      ever before come as a little child? Did any of them begin to lead
      while yet in arms? Lodges there upon any other baby brow “the
      round and top of sovereignty?” What distinguished Christ and His
      Christian followers from all the world? Behold! no mighty
      monarch, but “a little child shall lead them!”

      You may see through the glass darkly, you may not know or
      understand the blessedness of faith in Him as He would have you
      know it, but there is nothing that can dim the light that
      radiates from that birth in the rude cave back of the inn. Ah, it
      pierces through the darkness of that shrouding night. It shines
      to-day. Still sparkles the Star in the East. He is that Star.

      There is nothing that can take from mankind—even doubting
      mankind—the spirit of Christ and the Christmas season. Our
      celebrations do not rest upon the conclusions of logic, or the
      demonstrations of philosophy; I would not even argue that they
      depend inevitably or absolutely upon the possession of a certain
      faith in Jesus, but we accept Christmas, nevertheless; we
      endeavour to apply the Christmas spirit, for just once in the
      year; it may be because we cannot, try as we may, crush out
      utterly and entirely the divinity that is in us that makes for
      God. The stories and tales for Christmas which have for their
      theme the hard heart softened are not mere fictions of the
      imagination. They rest upon an instinctive consciousness of a
      profound philosophic truth.

      What is the unpardonable sin, I wonder? Is it to be persistently
      and forever unkind? Does it mean perhaps the absolute refusal to
      accept the principle of love which is indeed creation’s final
      law? The lessons of the Christmastide are so many; the appeals
      that now may be made to humanity crowd to the lips from full
      minds and fuller hearts. Might we not reduce them all to the
      explication of the underlying principle of God’s purpose to us,
      as expressed in those themic words of love with which angels and
      men greeted the advent of the Child on the first Christmas
      morning, “Good will toward men?”

      Let us then show our good will toward men by doing good and
      bringing happiness to someone—if not to everyone—at this
      Christmas season. Put aside the memories of disappointments, of
      sorrows that have not vanished, of cares that still burden, and
      do good in spite of them because you would not dim the brightness
      of the present for any human heart with the shadows of old
      regrets. Do good because of a future which opens possibilities
      before you, for others, if not for yourselves.

      Brethren, friends, all, let us make up our minds that we will be
      kindly affectioned one to another in our homes and out of them,
      on this approaching Christmas day. That the old debate, the
      ancient strife, the rankling recollection, the sharp contention,
      shall be put aside, that “envy, hatred, and malice, and all
      uncharitableness” shall be done away with. Let us forgive and
      forget; but if we cannot forget let us at least forgive. And so
      let there be peace between man and man at Christmas—a truce of
      God.

      Let us pray that Love shall come as a little child to our
      households. That He shall be in our hearts and shall find His
      expression in all that we do or say on this birthday of goodness
      and cheer for the world. Then let us resolve that the spirit of
      the day shall be carried out through our lives, that as Christ
      did not come for an hour, but for a lifetime, we would fain
      become as little children on this day of days that we may begin a
      new life of good will to men.

      Let us make this a new birthday of kindness and love that shall
      endure. That is a Christmas hope, a Christmas wish. Let us give
      to it the gracious expression of life among men.

FROM A FAR COUNTRY

      _Being a New Variation of an Ancient Theme_

      A STORY FOR GROWN-UPS


      I

      “_A certain man had two sons_”—so begins the best and most famous
      story in the world’s literature. Use of the absolute superlative
      is always dangerous, but none will gainsay that statement, I am
      sure. This story, which follows that familiar tale afar off,
      indeed, begins in the same way. And the parallelism between the
      two is exact up to a certain point. What difference a little
      point doth make; like the little fire, behold, how great a matter
      it kindleth! Indeed, lacking that one detail the older story
      would have had no value; it would not have been told; without its
      addition this would have been a repetition of the other.

      When the modern young prodigal came to himself, when he found
      himself no longer able to endure the husks of the swine like his
      ancient exemplar, when he rose and returned to his father because
      of that distaste, he found no father watching and waiting for him
      at the end of the road! Upon that change the action of this story
      hangs. It was a pity, too, because the elder brother was there
      and in a mood not unlike that of his famous prototype.

      Indeed, there was added to that elder brother’s natural
      resentment at the younger’s course the blinding power of a great
      sorrow, for the father of the two sons was dead. He had died of a
      broken heart. Possessed of no omniscience of mind or vision, he
      had been unable to foresee the long delayed turning point in the
      career of his younger son and death came too swiftly to enable
      them to meet again. So long as he had strength, that father had
      stood, as it were, at the top of the hill looking down the road
      watching and hoping.

      And but the day before the tardy prodigal’s return he had been
      laid away with his own fathers in the God’s acre around the
      village church in the Pennsylvania hills. Therefore there was no
      fatted calf ready for the disillusioned youth whose waywardness
      had killed his father. It will be remembered that the original
      elder brother objected seriously to fatted calves on such
      occasions. Indeed, the funeral baked meats would coldly furnish
      forth a welcoming meal if any such were called for.

      For all his waywardness, for all his self-will, the younger son
      had loved his father well, and it was a terrible shock to him
      (having come to his senses) to find that he had returned too
      late. And for all his hardness and narrowness the eldest son also
      had loved his father well—strong tribute to the quality of the
      dead parent—and when he found himself bereft he naturally visited
      wrath upon the head of him who he believed rightly was the cause
      of the untimely death of the old man.

      As he sat in the study, if such it might be called, of the
      departed, before the old-fashioned desk with its household and
      farm and business accounts, which in their order and method and
      long use were eloquent of his provident and farseeing father, his
      heart was hot within his breast. Grief and resentment alike
      gnawed at his vitals. They had received vivid reports, even in
      the little town in which they dwelt, of the wild doings of the
      wanderer, but they had enjoyed no direct communication with him.
      After a while even rumour ceased to busy itself with the doings
      of the youth. He had dropped out of their lives utterly after he
      passed over the hills and far away.

      The father had failed slowly for a time, only to break suddenly
      and swiftly in the end. And the hurried frantic search for the
      missing had brought no results. Ironically the god of chance had
      led the young man’s repentant footsteps to the door too late.

      “Where’s father?” cried John Carstairs to the startled woman who
      stared at him as if she had seen a ghost as, at his knock, she
      opened the door which he had found locked, not against him, but
      the hour was late and it was the usual nightly precaution:

      “Your brother is in your father’s study, sir,” faltered the
      servant at last.

      “Umph! Will,” said the man, his face changing. “I’d rather see
      father first.”

      “I think you had better see Mr. William, sir.”

      “What’s the matter, Janet?” asked young Carstairs anxiously. “Is
      father ill?”

      “Yes, sir! indeed I think you had bettor see Mr. William at once,
      Mr. John.”

      Strangely moved by the obvious agitation of the ancient servitor
      of the house who had known him from childhood, John Carstairs
      hurried down the long hall to the door of his father’s study.
      Always a scapegrace, generally in difficulties, full of mischief,
      he had approached that door many times in fear of well merited
      punishment which was sure to be meted out to him. And he came to
      it with the old familiar apprehension that night, if from a
      different cause. He never dreamed that his father was anything
      but ill. He must see his brother. He stood in no little awe of
      that brother, who was his exact antithesis in almost everything.
      They had not got along particularly well. If his father had been
      inside the door he would have hesitated with his hand on the
      knob. If his father had not been ill he would not have attempted
      to face his brother. But his anxiety, which was increased by a
      sudden foreboding, for Janet, the maid, had looked at him so
      strangely, moved him to quick action. He threw the door open
      instantly. What he saw did not reassure him. William was clad in
      funeral black. He wore a long frock coat instead of the usual
      knockabout suit he affected on the farm. His face was white and
      haggard. There was an instant interchange of names.

      “John!”

      “William!”

      And then—

      “Is father ill?” burst out the younger.

      “Janet said—”

      “Dead!” interposed William harshly, all his indignation flaming
      into speech and action as he confronted the cause of the
      disaster.

      “Dead! Good God!”

      “God had nothing to do with it.”

      “You mean?”

      “You did it.”

      “I?”

      “Yes. Your drunken revelry, your reckless extravagance, your
      dissipation with women, your unfeeling silence, your—”

      “Stop!” cried the younger. “I have come to my senses, I can’t
      bear it.”

      “I’ll say it if it kills you. You did it, I repeat. He longed and
      prayed and waited and you didn’t come. You didn’t write. We could
      hear nothing. The best father on earth.”

      The younger man sank down in a chair and covered his face with
      his hands.

      “When?” he gasped out finally.

PREFACE


      Christmas is one of the great days of obligation and observance
      in the Church of which I am a Priest; but it is much more than
      that, it is one of the great days of obligation and observance in
      the world. Furthermore it is one of the evidences of the power of
      Him Whose birth we commemorate that its observation is not
      limited by conditions of race and creed. Those who fail to see in
      Him what we see nevertheless see something and even by imperfect
      visions are moved to joy. The world transmutes that joy into
      blessing, not merely by giving of its substance but of its soul
      because men perceive that it is for the soul’s good and because
      they hope to receive its benefits although they well know that
      giving is far better than receiving, in the very words of Him Who
      gave us the greatest of all gifts—Himself.

      As a Priest of the Church, as a Missionary in the Far West, as
      the Rector of large and important parishes I have been brought in
      touch with varied life. Christmas in all its phases is familiar
      to me. The author of many books and stories as well as the
      preacher of many sermons, it is natural that Christmas should
      have engaged a large part of my attention. Out of the abundance
      of material which I have accumulated in the course of a long
      ministry and a longer life I have gathered here a sheaf of things
      I have written about Christmas; personal adventures, stories
      suggested by the old yet ever-new theme; meditations, words of
      advice which I am old enough to be entitled to give; and last but
      not least good wishes and good will. I might even call this
      little volume _A Book of Good Will toward Men_. And so fit it not
      only for Christmas but for all other seasons as well.

      If it shall add to your joy in Christmas, dear reader, and better
      still, if it shall move you to add to the joy of some one else at
      Christmas-tide or in any other season, I shall be well repaid for
      my efforts and incidentally you will also be repaid for your
      purchase.

A CHRISTMAS GREETING

      “_Good Will Toward Men”—St. Luke 11-14._


      There was a time when the spirit of Christmas was of the present.
      There is a period when most of it is of the past. There shall
      come a day perhaps when all of it will be of the future. The
      child time, the present; the middle years, the past; old age, the
      future.

      Come to my mind Christmas Days of long ago. As a boy again I
      enter into the spirit of the Christmas stockings hanging before
      my fire. I know what the children think to-day. I recall what
      they feel.

      Passes childhood, and I look down the nearer years. There rise
      before me remembrances of Christmas Days on storm-tossed seas,
      where waves beat upon the ice-bound ship. I recall again the
      bitter touch of water-warping winter, of drifts of snow, of
      wind-swept plains. In the gamut of my remembrance I am once more
      in the poor, mean, lonely little sanctuary out on the prairie,
      with a handful of Christians, mostly women, gathered together in
      the freezing, draughty building. In later years I worship in the
      great cathedral church, ablaze with lights, verdant and fragrant
      with the evergreen pines, echoing with joyful carols and
      celestial harmonies. My recollections are of contrasts like those
      of life—joy and sadness, poverty and ease.

      And the pictures are full of faces, many of which may be seen no
      more by earthly vision. I miss the clasp of vanished hands, I
      crave the sound of voices stilled. As we old and older grow,
      there is a note of sadness in our glee. Whether we will or not we
      must twine the cypress with the holly. The recollection of each
      passing year brings deeper regret. How many have gone from those
      circles that we recall when we were children? How many little
      feet that pattered upon the stair on Christmas morning now tread
      softer paths and walk in broader ways; sisters and brothers who
      used to come back from the far countries to the old home—alas,
      they cannot come from the farther country in which they now are,
      and perhaps, saddest thought of all, we would not wish them to
      come again. How many, with whom we joined hands around the
      Christmas tree, have gone?

      Circles are broken, families are separated, loved ones are lost,
      but the old world sweeps on. Others come to take our places. As
      we stood at the knee of some unforgotten mother, so other
      children stand. As we listened to the story of the Christ Child
      from the lips of some grey old father, so other children listen
      and we ourselves perchance are fathers or mothers too. Other
      groups come to us for the deathless story. Little heads which
      recall vanished halcyon days of youth bend around another younger
      mother. Smaller hands than ours write letters to Santa Claus and
      hear the story, the sweetest story ever told, of the Baby who
      came to Mary and through her to all the daughters and sons of
      women on that winter night on the Bethlehem hills.

      And we thank God for the children who take us out of the past,
      out of ourselves, away from recollections that weigh us down; the
      children that weave in the woof and warp of life when our own
      youth has passed, some of the buoyancy, the joy, the happiness of
      the present; the children in whose opening lives we turn
      hopefully to the future. We thank God at this Christmas season
      that it pleased Him to send His beloved Son to come to us as a
      little child, like any other child. We thank God that in the
      lesser sense we may see in every child who comes to-day another
      incarnation of divinity. We thank God for the portion of His
      Spirit with which He dowers every child of man, just as we thank
      Him for pouring it all upon the Infant in the Manger.

      There is no age that has not had its prophet. No country, no
      people, but that has produced its leader. But did any of them
      ever before come as a little child? Did any of them begin to lead
      while yet in arms? Lodges there upon any other baby brow “the
      round and top of sovereignty?” What distinguished Christ and His
      Christian followers from all the world? Behold! no mighty
      monarch, but “a little child shall lead them!”

      You may see through the glass darkly, you may not know or
      understand the blessedness of faith in Him as He would have you
      know it, but there is nothing that can dim the light that
      radiates from that birth in the rude cave back of the inn. Ah, it
      pierces through the darkness of that shrouding night. It shines
      to-day. Still sparkles the Star in the East. He is that Star.

      There is nothing that can take from mankind—even doubting
      mankind—the spirit of Christ and the Christmas season. Our
      celebrations do not rest upon the conclusions of logic, or the
      demonstrations of philosophy; I would not even argue that they
      depend inevitably or absolutely upon the possession of a certain
      faith in Jesus, but we accept Christmas, nevertheless; we
      endeavour to apply the Christmas spirit, for just once in the
      year; it may be because we cannot, try as we may, crush out
      utterly and entirely the divinity that is in us that makes for
      God. The stories and tales for Christmas which have for their
      theme the hard heart softened are not mere fictions of the
      imagination. They rest upon an instinctive consciousness of a
      profound philosophic truth.

      What is the unpardonable sin, I wonder? Is it to be persistently
      and forever unkind? Does it mean perhaps the absolute refusal to
      accept the principle of love which is indeed creation’s final
      law? The lessons of the Christmastide are so many; the appeals
      that now may be made to humanity crowd to the lips from full
      minds and fuller hearts. Might we not reduce them all to the
      explication of the underlying principle of God’s purpose to us,
      as expressed in those themic words of love with which angels and
      men greeted the advent of the Child on the first Christmas
      morning, “Good will toward men?”

      Let us then show our good will toward men by doing good and
      bringing happiness to someone—if not to everyone—at this
      Christmas season. Put aside the memories of disappointments, of
      sorrows that have not vanished, of cares that still burden, and
      do good in spite of them because you would not dim the brightness
      of the present for any human heart with the shadows of old
      regrets. Do good because of a future which opens possibilities
      before you, for others, if not for yourselves.

      Brethren, friends, all, let us make up our minds that we will be
      kindly affectioned one to another in our homes and out of them,
      on this approaching Christmas day. That the old debate, the
      ancient strife, the rankling recollection, the sharp contention,
      shall be put aside, that “envy, hatred, and malice, and all
      uncharitableness” shall be done away with. Let us forgive and
      forget; but if we cannot forget let us at least forgive. And so
      let there be peace between man and man at Christmas—a truce of
      God.

      Let us pray that Love shall come as a little child to our
      households. That He shall be in our hearts and shall find His
      expression in all that we do or say on this birthday of goodness
      and cheer for the world. Then let us resolve that the spirit of
      the day shall be carried out through our lives, that as Christ
      did not come for an hour, but for a lifetime, we would fain
      become as little children on this day of days that we may begin a
      new life of good will to men.

      Let us make this a new birthday of kindness and love that shall
      endure. That is a Christmas hope, a Christmas wish. Let us give
      to it the gracious expression of life among men.

FROM A FAR COUNTRY

      _Being a New Variation of an Ancient Theme_

      A STORY FOR GROWN-UPS


      I

      “_A certain man had two sons_”—so begins the best and most famous
      story in the world’s literature. Use of the absolute superlative
      is always dangerous, but none will gainsay that statement, I am
      sure. This story, which follows that familiar tale afar off,
      indeed, begins in the same way. And the parallelism between the
      two is exact up to a certain point. What difference a little
      point doth make; like the little fire, behold, how great a matter
      it kindleth! Indeed, lacking that one detail the older story
      would have had no value; it would not have been told; without its
      addition this would have been a repetition of the other.

      When the modern young prodigal came to himself, when he found
      himself no longer able to endure the husks of the swine like his
      ancient exemplar, when he rose and returned to his father because
      of that distaste, he found no father watching and waiting for him
      at the end of the road! Upon that change the action of this story
      hangs. It was a pity, too, because the elder brother was there
      and in a mood not unlike that of his famous prototype.

      Indeed, there was added to that elder brother’s natural
      resentment at the younger’s course the blinding power of a great
      sorrow, for the father of the two sons was dead. He had died of a
      broken heart. Possessed of no omniscience of mind or vision, he
      had been unable to foresee the long delayed turning point in the
      career of his younger son and death came too swiftly to enable
      them to meet again. So long as he had strength, that father had
      stood, as it were, at the top of the hill looking down the road
      watching and hoping.

      And but the day before the tardy prodigal’s return he had been
      laid away with his own fathers in the God’s acre around the
      village church in the Pennsylvania hills. Therefore there was no
      fatted calf ready for the disillusioned youth whose waywardness
      had killed his father. It will be remembered that the original
      elder brother objected seriously to fatted calves on such
      occasions. Indeed, the funeral baked meats would coldly furnish
      forth a welcoming meal if any such were called for.

      For all his waywardness, for all his self-will, the younger son
      had loved his father well, and it was a terrible shock to him
      (having come to his senses) to find that he had returned too
      late. And for all his hardness and narrowness the eldest son also
      had loved his father well—strong tribute to the quality of the
      dead parent—and when he found himself bereft he naturally visited
      wrath upon the head of him who he believed rightly was the cause
      of the untimely death of the old man.

      As he sat in the study, if such it might be called, of the
      departed, before the old-fashioned desk with its household and
      farm and business accounts, which in their order and method and
      long use were eloquent of his provident and farseeing father, his
      heart was hot within his breast. Grief and resentment alike
      gnawed at his vitals. They had received vivid reports, even in
      the little town in which they dwelt, of the wild doings of the
      wanderer, but they had enjoyed no direct communication with him.
      After a while even rumour ceased to busy itself with the doings
      of the youth. He had dropped out of their lives utterly after he
      passed over the hills and far away.

      The father had failed slowly for a time, only to break suddenly
      and swiftly in the end. And the hurried frantic search for the
      missing had brought no results. Ironically the god of chance had
      led the young man’s repentant footsteps to the door too late.

      “Where’s father?” cried John Carstairs to the startled woman who
      stared at him as if she had seen a ghost as, at his knock, she
      opened the door which he had found locked, not against him, but
      the hour was late and it was the usual nightly precaution:

      “Your brother is in your father’s study, sir,” faltered the
      servant at last.

      “Umph! Will,” said the man, his face changing. “I’d rather see
      father first.”

      “I think you had better see Mr. William, sir.”

      “What’s the matter, Janet?” asked young Carstairs anxiously. “Is
      father ill?”

      “Yes, sir! indeed I think you had bettor see Mr. William at once,
      Mr. John.”

      Strangely moved by the obvious agitation of the ancient servitor
      of the house who had known him from childhood, John Carstairs
      hurried down the long hall to the door of his father’s study.
      Always a scapegrace, generally in difficulties, full of mischief,
      he had approached that door many times in fear of well merited
      punishment which was sure to be meted out to him. And he came to
      it with the old familiar apprehension that night, if from a
      different cause. He never dreamed that his father was anything
      but ill. He must see his brother. He stood in no little awe of
      that brother, who was his exact antithesis in almost everything.
      They had not got along particularly well. If his father had been
      inside the door he would have hesitated with his hand on the
      knob. If his father had not been ill he would not have attempted
      to face his brother. But his anxiety, which was increased by a
      sudden foreboding, for Janet, the maid, had looked at him so
      strangely, moved him to quick action. He threw the door open
      instantly. What he saw did not reassure him. William was clad in
      funeral black. He wore a long frock coat instead of the usual
      knockabout suit he affected on the farm. His face was white and
      haggard. There was an instant interchange of names.

      “John!”

      “William!”

      And then—

      “Is father ill?” burst out the younger.

      “Janet said—”

      “Dead!” interposed William harshly, all his indignation flaming
      into speech and action as he confronted the cause of the
      disaster.

      “Dead! Good God!”

      “God had nothing to do with it.”

      “You mean?”

      “You did it.”

      “I?”

      “Yes. Your drunken revelry, your reckless extravagance, your
      dissipation with women, your unfeeling silence, your—”

      “Stop!” cried the younger. “I have come to my senses, I can’t
      bear it.”

      “I’ll say it if it kills you. You did it, I repeat. He longed and
      prayed and waited and you didn’t come. You didn’t write. We could
      hear nothing. The best father on earth.”

      The younger man sank down in a chair and covered his face with
      his hands.

      “When?” he gasped out finally.

PREFACE


      Christmas is one of the great days of obligation and observance
      in the Church of which I am a Priest; but it is much more than
      that, it is one of the great days of obligation and observance in
      the world. Furthermore it is one of the evidences of the power of
      Him Whose birth we commemorate that its observation is not
      limited by conditions of race and creed. Those who fail to see in
      Him what we see nevertheless see something and even by imperfect
      visions are moved to joy. The world transmutes that joy into
      blessing, not merely by giving of its substance but of its soul
      because men perceive that it is for the soul’s good and because
      they hope to receive its benefits although they well know that
      giving is far better than receiving, in the very words of Him Who
      gave us the greatest of all gifts—Himself.

      As a Priest of the Church, as a Missionary in the Far West, as
      the Rector of large and important parishes I have been brought in
      touch with varied life. Christmas in all its phases is familiar
      to me. The author of many books and stories as well as the
      preacher of many sermons, it is natural that Christmas should
      have engaged a large part of my attention. Out of the abundance
      of material which I have accumulated in the course of a long
      ministry and a longer life I have gathered here a sheaf of things
      I have written about Christmas; personal adventures, stories
      suggested by the old yet ever-new theme; meditations, words of
      advice which I am old enough to be entitled to give; and last but
      not least good wishes and good will. I might even call this
      little volume _A Book of Good Will toward Men_. And so fit it not
      only for Christmas but for all other seasons as well.

      If it shall add to your joy in Christmas, dear reader, and better
      still, if it shall move you to add to the joy of some one else at
      Christmas-tide or in any other season, I shall be well repaid for
      my efforts and incidentally you will also be repaid for your
      purchase.

A CHRISTMAS GREETING

      “_Good Will Toward Men”—St. Luke 11-14._


      There was a time when the spirit of Christmas was of the present.
      There is a period when most of it is of the past. There shall
      come a day perhaps when all of it will be of the future. The
      child time, the present; the middle years, the past; old age, the
      future.

      Come to my mind Christmas Days of long ago. As a boy again I
      enter into the spirit of the Christmas stockings hanging before
      my fire. I know what the children think to-day. I recall what
      they feel.

      Passes childhood, and I look down the nearer years. There rise
      before me remembrances of Christmas Days on storm-tossed seas,
      where waves beat upon the ice-bound ship. I recall again the
      bitter touch of water-warping winter, of drifts of snow, of
      wind-swept plains. In the gamut of my remembrance I am once more
      in the poor, mean, lonely little sanctuary out on the prairie,
      with a handful of Christians, mostly women, gathered together in
      the freezing, draughty building. In later years I worship in the
      great cathedral church, ablaze with lights, verdant and fragrant
      with the evergreen pines, echoing with joyful carols and
      celestial harmonies. My recollections are of contrasts like those
      of life—joy and sadness, poverty and ease.

      And the pictures are full of faces, many of which may be seen no
      more by earthly vision. I miss the clasp of vanished hands, I
      crave the sound of voices stilled. As we old and older grow,
      there is a note of sadness in our glee. Whether we will or not we
      must twine the cypress with the holly. The recollection of each
      passing year brings deeper regret. How many have gone from those
      circles that we recall when we were children? How many little
      feet that pattered upon the stair on Christmas morning now tread
      softer paths and walk in broader ways; sisters and brothers who
      used to come back from the far countries to the old home—alas,
      they cannot come from the farther country in which they now are,
      and perhaps, saddest thought of all, we would not wish them to
      come again. How many, with whom we joined hands around the
      Christmas tree, have gone?

      Circles are broken, families are separated, loved ones are lost,
      but the old world sweeps on. Others come to take our places. As
      we stood at the knee of some unforgotten mother, so other
      children stand. As we listened to the story of the Christ Child
      from the lips of some grey old father, so other children listen
      and we ourselves perchance are fathers or mothers too. Other
      groups come to us for the deathless story. Little heads which
      recall vanished halcyon days of youth bend around another younger
      mother. Smaller hands than ours write letters to Santa Claus and
      hear the story, the sweetest story ever told, of the Baby who
      came to Mary and through her to all the daughters and sons of
      women on that winter night on the Bethlehem hills.

      And we thank God for the children who take us out of the past,
      out of ourselves, away from recollections that weigh us down; the
      children that weave in the woof and warp of life when our own
      youth has passed, some of the buoyancy, the joy, the happiness of
      the present; the children in whose opening lives we turn
      hopefully to the future. We thank God at this Christmas season
      that it pleased Him to send His beloved Son to come to us as a
      little child, like any other child. We thank God that in the
      lesser sense we may see in every child who comes to-day another
      incarnation of divinity. We thank God for the portion of His
      Spirit with which He dowers every child of man, just as we thank
      Him for pouring it all upon the Infant in the Manger.

      There is no age that has not had its prophet. No country, no
      people, but that has produced its leader. But did any of them
      ever before come as a little child? Did any of them begin to lead
      while yet in arms? Lodges there upon any other baby brow “the
      round and top of sovereignty?” What distinguished Christ and His
      Christian followers from all the world? Behold! no mighty
      monarch, but “a little child shall lead them!”

      You may see through the glass darkly, you may not know or
      understand the blessedness of faith in Him as He would have you
      know it, but there is nothing that can dim the light that
      radiates from that birth in the rude cave back of the inn. Ah, it
      pierces through the darkness of that shrouding night. It shines
      to-day. Still sparkles the Star in the East. He is that Star.

      There is nothing that can take from mankind—even doubting
      mankind—the spirit of Christ and the Christmas season. Our
      celebrations do not rest upon the conclusions of logic, or the
      demonstrations of philosophy; I would not even argue that they
      depend inevitably or absolutely upon the possession of a certain
      faith in Jesus, but we accept Christmas, nevertheless; we
      endeavour to apply the Christmas spirit, for just once in the
      year; it may be because we cannot, try as we may, crush out
      utterly and entirely the divinity that is in us that makes for
      God. The stories and tales for Christmas which have for their
      theme the hard heart softened are not mere fictions of the
      imagination. They rest upon an instinctive consciousness of a
      profound philosophic truth.

      What is the unpardonable sin, I wonder? Is it to be persistently
      and forever unkind? Does it mean perhaps the absolute refusal to
      accept the principle of love which is indeed creation’s final
      law? The lessons of the Christmastide are so many; the appeals
      that now may be made to humanity crowd to the lips from full
      minds and fuller hearts. Might we not reduce them all to the
      explication of the underlying principle of God’s purpose to us,
      as expressed in those themic words of love with which angels and
      men greeted the advent of the Child on the first Christmas
      morning, “Good will toward men?”

      Let us then show our good will toward men by doing good and
      bringing happiness to someone—if not to everyone—at this
      Christmas season. Put aside the memories of disappointments, of
      sorrows that have not vanished, of cares that still burden, and
      do good in spite of them because you would not dim the brightness
      of the present for any human heart with the shadows of old
      regrets. Do good because of a future which opens possibilities
      before you, for others, if not for yourselves.

      Brethren, friends, all, let us make up our minds that we will be
      kindly affectioned one to another in our homes and out of them,
      on this approaching Christmas day. That the old debate, the
      ancient strife, the rankling recollection, the sharp contention,
      shall be put aside, that “envy, hatred, and malice, and all
      uncharitableness” shall be done away with. Let us forgive and
      forget; but if we cannot forget let us at least forgive. And so
      let there be peace between man and man at Christmas—a truce of
      God.

      Let us pray that Love shall come as a little child to our
      households. That He shall be in our hearts and shall find His
      expression in all that we do or say on this birthday of goodness
      and cheer for the world. Then let us resolve that the spirit of
      the day shall be carried out through our lives, that as Christ
      did not come for an hour, but for a lifetime, we would fain
      become as little children on this day of days that we may begin a
      new life of good will to men.

      Let us make this a new birthday of kindness and love that shall
      endure. That is a Christmas hope, a Christmas wish. Let us give
      to it the gracious expression of life among men.

      Strangely moved by the obvious agitation of the ancient servitor

      but ill. He must see his brother. He stood in no little awe of
      that brother, who was his exact antithesis in almost everything.
      They had not got along particularly well. If his father had been
      inside the door he would have hesitated with his hand on the
      knob. If his father had not been ill he would not have attempted
      to face his brother. But his anxiety, which was increased by a
      sudden foreboding, for Janet, the maid, had looked at him so
      strangely, moved him to quick action. He threw the door open
      instantly. What he saw did not reassure him. William was clad in
      funeral black. He wore a long frock coat instead of the usual
      knockabout suit he affected on the farm. His face was white and
      haggard. There was an instant interchange of names.

      “John!”

      “William!”

      And then—

      “Is father ill?” burst out the younger.

      “Janet said—”

      “Dead!” interposed William harshly, all his indignation flaming
      into speech and action as he confronted the cause of the
      disaster.

      “Dead! Good God!”

      “God had nothing to do with it.”

      “You mean?”

      “You did it.”

      “I?”

      “Yes. Your drunken revelry, your reckless extravagance, your
      dissipation with women, your unfeeling silence, your—”

      “Stop!” cried the younger. “I have come to my senses, I can’t
      bear it.”

      “I’ll say it if it kills you. You did it, I repeat. He longed and
      prayed and waited and you didn’t come. You didn’t write. We could
      hear nothing. The best father on earth.”

      The younger man sank down in a chair and covered his face with
      his hands.

      “When?” he gasped out finally.

PREFACE


      Christmas is one of the great days of obligation and observance
      in the Church of which I am a Priest; but it is much more than
      that, it is one of the great days of obligation and observance in
      the world. Furthermore it is one of the evidences of the power of
      Him Whose birth we commemorate that its observation is not
      limited by conditions of race and creed. Those who fail to see in
      Him what we see nevertheless see something and even by imperfect
      visions are moved to joy. The world transmutes that joy into
      blessing, not merely by giving of its substance but of its soul
      because men perceive that it is for the soul’s good and because
      they hope to receive its benefits although they well know that
      giving is far better than receiving, in the very words of Him Who
      gave us the greatest of all gifts—Himself.

      As a Priest of the Church, as a Missionary in the Far West, as
      the Rector of large and important parishes I have been brought in
      touch with varied life. Christmas in all its phases is familiar
      to me. The author of many books and stories as well as the
      preacher of many sermons, it is natural that Christmas should
      have engaged a large part of my attention. Out of the abundance
      of material which I have accumulated in the course of a long
      ministry and a longer life I have gathered here a sheaf of things
      I have written about Christmas; personal adventures, stories
      suggested by the old yet ever-new theme; meditations, words of
      advice which I am old enough to be entitled to give; and last but
      not least good wishes and good will. I might even call this
      little volume _A Book of Good Will toward Men_. And so fit it not
      only for Christmas but for all other seasons as well.

      If it shall add to your joy in Christmas, dear reader, and better
      still, if it shall move you to add to the joy of some one else at
      Christmas-tide or in any other season, I shall be well repaid for
      my efforts and incidentally you will also be repaid for your
      purchase.

A CHRISTMAS GREETING

      “_Good Will Toward Men”—St. Luke 11-14._


      There was a time when the spirit of Christmas was of the present.
      There is a period when most of it is of the past. There shall
      come a day perhaps when all of it will be of the future. The
      child time, the present; the middle years, the past; old age, the
      future.

      Come to my mind Christmas Days of long ago. As a boy again I
      enter into the spirit of the Christmas stockings hanging before
      my fire. I know what the children think to-day. I recall what
      they feel.

      Passes childhood, and I look down the nearer years. There rise
      before me remembrances of Christmas Days on storm-tossed seas,
      where waves beat upon the ice-bound ship. I recall again the
      bitter touch of water-warping winter, of drifts of snow, of
      wind-swept plains. In the gamut of my remembrance I am once more
      in the poor, mean, lonely little sanctuary out on the prairie,
      with a handful of Christians, mostly women, gathered together in
      the freezing, draughty building. In later years I worship in the
      great cathedral church, ablaze with lights, verdant and fragrant
      with the evergreen pines, echoing with joyful carols and
      celestial harmonies. My recollections are of contrasts like those
      of life—joy and sadness, poverty and ease.

      And the pictures are full of faces, many of which may be seen no
      more by earthly vision. I miss the clasp of vanished hands, I
      crave the sound of voices stilled. As we old and older grow,
      there is a note of sadness in our glee. Whether we will or not we
      must twine the cypress with the holly. The recollection of each
      passing year brings deeper regret. How many have gone from those
      circles that we recall when we were children? How many little
      feet that pattered upon the stair on Christmas morning now tread
      softer paths and walk in broader ways; sisters and brothers who
      used to come back from the far countries to the old home—alas,
      they cannot come from the farther country in which they now are,
      and perhaps, saddest thought of all, we would not wish them to
      come again. How many, with whom we joined hands around the
      Christmas tree, have gone?

      Circles are broken, families are separated, loved ones are lost,
      but the old world sweeps on. Others come to take our places. As
      we stood at the knee of some unforgotten mother, so other
      children stand. As we listened to the story of the Christ Child
      from the lips of some grey old father, so other children listen
      and we ourselves perchance are fathers or mothers too. Other
      groups come to us for the deathless story. Little heads which
      recall vanished halcyon days of youth bend around another younger
      mother. Smaller hands than ours write letters to Santa Claus and
      hear the story, the sweetest story ever told, of the Baby who
      came to Mary and through her to all the daughters and sons of
      women on that winter night on the Bethlehem hills.

      And we thank God for the children who take us out of the past,
      out of ourselves, away from recollections that weigh us down; the
      children that weave in the woof and warp of life when our own
      youth has passed, some of the buoyancy, the joy, the happiness of
      the present; the children in whose opening lives we turn
      hopefully to the future. We thank God at this Christmas season
      that it pleased Him to send His beloved Son to come to us as a
      little child, like any other child. We thank God that in the
      lesser sense we may see in every child who comes to-day another
      incarnation of divinity. We thank God for the portion of His
      Spirit with which He dowers every child of man, just as we thank
      Him for pouring it all upon the Infant in the Manger.

      There is no age that has not had its prophet. No country, no
      people, but that has produced its leader. But did any of them
      ever before come as a little child? Did any of them begin to lead
      while yet in arms? Lodges there upon any other baby brow “the
      round and top of sovereignty?” What distinguished Christ and His
      Christian followers from all the world? Behold! no mighty
      monarch, but “a little child shall lead them!”

      You may see through the glass darkly, you may not know or
      understand the blessedness of faith in Him as He would have you
      know it, but there is nothing that can dim the light that
      radiates from that birth in the rude cave back of the inn. Ah, it
      pierces through the darkness of that shrouding night. It shines
      to-day. Still sparkles the Star in the East. He is that Star.

      There is nothing that can take from mankind—even doubting
      mankind—the spirit of Christ and the Christmas season. Our
      celebrations do not rest upon the conclusions of logic, or the
      demonstrations of philosophy; I would not even argue that they
      depend inevitably or absolutely upon the possession of a certain
      faith in Jesus, but we accept Christmas, nevertheless; we
      endeavour to apply the Christmas spirit, for just once in the
      year; it may be because we cannot, try as we may, crush out
      utterly and entirely the divinity that is in us that makes for
      God. The stories and tales for Christmas which have for their
      theme the hard heart softened are not mere fictions of the
      imagination. They rest upon an instinctive consciousness of a
      profound philosophic truth.

      What is the unpardonable sin, I wonder? Is it to be persistently
      and forever unkind? Does it mean perhaps the absolute refusal to
      accept the principle of love which is indeed creation’s final
      law? The lessons of the Christmastide are so many; the appeals
      that now may be made to humanity crowd to the lips from full
      minds and fuller hearts. Might we not reduce them all to the
      explication of the underlying principle of God’s purpose to us,
      as expressed in those themic words of love with which angels and
      men greeted the advent of the Child on the first Christmas
      morning, “Good will toward men?”

      Let us then show our good will toward men by doing good and
      bringing happiness to someone—if not to everyone—at this
      Christmas season. Put aside the memories of disappointments, of
      sorrows that have not vanished, of cares that still burden, and
      do good in spite of them because you would not dim the brightness
      of the present for any human heart with the shadows of old
      regrets. Do good because of a future which opens possibilities
      before you, for others, if not for yourselves.

      Brethren, friends, all, let us make up our minds that we will be
      kindly affectioned one to another in our homes and out of them,
      on this approaching Christmas day. That the old debate, the
      ancient strife, the rankling recollection, the sharp contention,
      shall be put aside, that “envy, hatred, and malice, and all
      uncharitableness” shall be done away with. Let us forgive and
      forget; but if we cannot forget let us at least forgive. And so
      let there be peace between man and man at Christmas—a truce of
      God.

      Let us pray that Love shall come as a little child to our
      households. That He shall be in our hearts and shall find His
      expression in all that we do or say on this birthday of goodness
      and cheer for the world. Then let us resolve that the spirit of
      the day shall be carried out through our lives, that as Christ
      did not come for an hour, but for a lifetime, we would fain
      become as little children on this day of days that we may begin a
      new life of good will to men.

      Let us make this a new birthday of kindness and love that shall
      endure. That is a Christmas hope, a Christmas wish. Let us give
      to it the gracious expression of life among men.

FROM A FAR COUNTRY

      _Being a New Variation of an Ancient Theme_

      A STORY FOR GROWN-UPS


      I

      “_A certain man had two sons_”—so begins the best and most famous
      story in the world’s literature. Use of the absolute superlative
      is always dangerous, but none will gainsay that statement, I am
      sure. This story, which follows that familiar tale afar off,
      indeed, begins in the same way. And the parallelism between the
      two is exact up to a certain point. What difference a little
      point doth make; like the little fire, behold, how great a matter
      it kindleth! Indeed, lacking that one detail the older story
      would have had no value; it would not have been told; without its
      addition this would have been a repetition of the other.

      When the modern young prodigal came to himself, when he found
      himself no longer able to endure the husks of the swine like his
      ancient exemplar, when he rose and returned to his father because
      of that distaste, he found no father watching and waiting for him
      at the end of the road! Upon that change the action of this story
      hangs. It was a pity, too, because the elder brother was there
      and in a mood not unlike that of his famous prototype.

      Indeed, there was added to that elder brother’s natural
      resentment at the younger’s course the blinding power of a great
      sorrow, for the father of the two sons was dead. He had died of a
      broken heart. Possessed of no omniscience of mind or vision, he
      had been unable to foresee the long delayed turning point in the
      career of his younger son and death came too swiftly to enable
      them to meet again. So long as he had strength, that father had
      stood, as it were, at the top of the hill looking down the road
      watching and hoping.

      And but the day before the tardy prodigal’s return he had been
      laid away with his own fathers in the God’s acre around the
      village church in the Pennsylvania hills. Therefore there was no
      fatted calf ready for the disillusioned youth whose waywardness
      had killed his father. It will be remembered that the original
      elder brother objected seriously to fatted calves on such
      occasions. Indeed, the funeral baked meats would coldly furnish
      forth a welcoming meal if any such were called for.

      For all his waywardness, for all his self-will, the younger son
      had loved his father well, and it was a terrible shock to him
      (having come to his senses) to find that he had returned too
      late. And for all his hardness and narrowness the eldest son also
      had loved his father well—strong tribute to the quality of the
      dead parent—and when he found himself bereft he naturally visited
      wrath upon the head of him who he believed rightly was the cause
      of the untimely death of the old man.

      As he sat in the study, if such it might be called, of the
      departed, before the old-fashioned desk with its household and
      farm and business accounts, which in their order and method and
      long use were eloquent of his provident and farseeing father, his
      heart was hot within his breast. Grief and resentment alike
      gnawed at his vitals. They had received vivid reports, even in
      the little town in which they dwelt, of the wild doings of the
      wanderer, but they had enjoyed no direct communication with him.
      After a while even rumour ceased to busy itself with the doings
      of the youth. He had dropped out of their lives utterly after he
      passed over the hills and far away.

      The father had failed slowly for a time, only to break suddenly
      and swiftly in the end. And the hurried frantic search for the
      missing had brought no results. Ironically the god of chance had
      led the young man’s repentant footsteps to the door too late.

      “Where’s father?” cried John Carstairs to the startled woman who
      stared at him as if she had seen a ghost as, at his knock, she
      opened the door which he had found locked, not against him, but
      the hour was late and it was the usual nightly precaution:

      “Your brother is in your father’s study, sir,” faltered the
      servant at last.

      “Umph! Will,” said the man, his face changing. “I’d rather see
      father first.”

      “I think you had better see Mr. William, sir.”

      “What’s the matter, Janet?” asked young Carstairs anxiously. “Is
      father ill?”

      “Yes, sir! indeed I think you had bettor see Mr. William at once,
      Mr. John.”

      Strangely moved by the obvious agitation of the ancient servitor
      of the house who had known him from childhood, John Carstairs
      hurried down the long hall to the door of his father’s study.
      Always a scapegrace, generally in difficulties, full of mischief,
      he had approached that door many times in fear of well merited
      punishment which was sure to be meted out to him. And he came to
      it with the old familiar apprehension that night, if from a
      different cause. He never dreamed that his father was anything
      but ill. He must see his brother. He stood in no little awe of
      that brother, who was his exact antithesis in almost everything.
      They had not got along particularly well. If his father had been
      inside the door he would have hesitated with his hand on the
      knob. If his father had not been ill he would not have attempted
      to face his brother. But his anxiety, which was increased by a
      sudden foreboding, for Janet, the maid, had looked at him so
      strangely, moved him to quick action. He threw the door open
      instantly. What he saw did not reassure him. William was clad in
      funeral black. He wore a long frock coat instead of the usual
      knockabout suit he affected on the farm. His face was white and
      haggard. There was an instant interchange of names.

      “John!”

      “William!”

      And then—

      “Is father ill?” burst out the younger.

      “Janet said—”

      “Dead!” interposed William harshly, all his indignation flaming
      into speech and action as he confronted the cause of the
      disaster.

      “Dead! Good God!”

      “God had nothing to do with it.”

      “You mean?”

      “You did it.”

      “I?”

      “Yes. Your drunken revelry, your reckless extravagance, your
      dissipation with women, your unfeeling silence, your—”

      “Stop!” cried the younger. “I have come to my senses, I can’t
      bear it.”

      “I’ll say it if it kills you. You did it, I repeat. He longed and
      prayed and waited and you didn’t come. You didn’t write. We could
      hear nothing. The best father on earth.”

      The younger man sank down in a chair and covered his face with
      his hands.

      “When?” he gasped out finally.
